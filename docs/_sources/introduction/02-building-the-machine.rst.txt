Building the Machine
####################

We start off by setting up a class that will manage the construction of our
machine. This class has a simple interface:

.. literalinclude:: ../../include/Machine.h
   :linenos:
   :caption: include/Machine.h

All parts we build for our simulator will be named, so we can display thta name
on output. The constructor for a part will provide a parameter where that name
can be set. All classes will also provide a simple methood that can be used to
set the name after the objects are created. 

We can test that the constructor in this class works by checking that the name
is properly set.

.. literalinclude::  ../../tests/test_machine.cpp
