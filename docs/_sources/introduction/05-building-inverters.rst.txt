Inverters
#########

For our first real part, let's create a simple inverter. This part has only one input, and one output. THe processing simply compliments whatever is on the inut, and places the result on the output.

..  literalinclude::    ../../include/Inverter.h
    :linenos:
    :caption: include/Inverter.h

Again, we test this class using the constructor and ``get_name`` method:

.. literalinclude::    ../../lib/parts/Inverter.cpp
   :linenos:
   :caption: lib/parts/Inverter.cpp
