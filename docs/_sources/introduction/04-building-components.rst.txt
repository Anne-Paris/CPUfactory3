Components
##########

The real digital magic in the machine happens in a variety of very simple
parts. Each part has a set of input signals, and a set of output signal
connections. We will provide a ``tick`` method that reads the inputs, performs
some processing, then delivers the results to the appropriate outpit points.

..  literalinclude::    ../../include/Component.h
    :linenos:
    :caption: include/Component.h

And the initial test case:

..  literalinclude::    ../../tests/test_component.cpp
    :linenos:
    :caption: tests/test_component.cpp

The Component class is not used directly in our simulator. Instread, it os a
base class from which all uniwue parts are derived. The component provided the
basic structure of a part. Only the ``tick`` method needs to be customized in
the actual part classes.
